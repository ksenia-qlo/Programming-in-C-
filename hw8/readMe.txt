The assignment was the most challenging of all the 8 we had
for me. It required thinking outside the box to approach a problem with
stack: namely, to create an array of indices to refer to positions
of the original array, so that we would not actually create a per se 
stack structure in C. 
Then, moveing the top variable only in case of left turn and doing
the shift of indices in the array of indices for positions of our array
of points in case of a right turn, minding that in right turn top does
not move,
it stays in the old position, because in case of right turn we do the
tryout for the crossproduct again, only moving 1 position back and
popping the middle element from the old right turn out.
Overall, i learnt a lot about abstract approach and creative solutions
for complex problems.
