I did not encounter significant difficulties.

The way i did it is: I broke the program down by a 2 parts:

- Counting how many many in 1 group (having same number of letters) are there
 in a file.

- Making a picture of count in 1 group with a number, space and
  "*"-s. Each "*" represents 4000 or less words.

I learnt that i need to allocate values to the array in C explicitly. That was a slight bumb for me, i could not figure out first why the output was very strange. It turned out that values get assugned randomly if you don't specify it in the code. Once i fixed that, the output was as expected.
