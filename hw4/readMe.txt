Pseudocode:
- For fulladder functions (2), i wrote out the result 
of 1-s and 0-s for Sum and CarryOut.
- make table of all possible combinations with 3
numbers including CarryIn and what the operation is between
first 2 numbers
- decide what operation is between that result 
and the 3d number, CarryIn.

Discussion:
I also had to come up with the procedure to retrieve a bit's value
from a binary number, that was the most challenging part
of the assignment for me.
Other that that, the assignment was straighforward and each step
expected was detailed in the assignment, which helped a lot with 
the creation of functions.
