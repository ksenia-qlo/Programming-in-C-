TFirst, i implemented the bitwise operations through my own code. I
learnt about function calls with returning pointers to arrays, memory
allocation to pointers and then subsequent reading the elements of the
array through incrementing the pointer. It was a huge learning
experience and was time and effort heavy and challenging. I enjoyed the
process a lot. 

On asking on further instructions, I learnt, however,
that the C language has the capability already to convert between
interger and binary types and perform bitwise comparison using the
bitwise operators even on the decimal original input. The conversion
happens on the background. 

I am, however, very glad that i implemented
the functionily of operators myself from scratch, before switching to
readily-availabla operators, because writing code for bitwise operators'
implementation and type transfer, I learnt about core C principles like
array manipulation using function calls and correct returns. This was
the heaviest learning part for me. The rest of the assignment is very
straight-forward from then on. Revising how variables are stored on
Stack in the Postfix notation was a useful experience as well.
