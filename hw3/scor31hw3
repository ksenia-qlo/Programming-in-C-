2. modules compile noW,noErr    15 pts: 15
   I compiled your itox.c and itoxDriver.c.
   Your driver and itox were late, but
itox.c was ontime, so I gave you the 
compile points.
   This is itox.
   I also tested your itoxKsenia, as submitted.
   I also built itox5 using the 5 tests.

3. itox works                   30 pts:  13
When I run itox with or without test.txt, I 
usually a single case with no output for quat or vig,
but in one case I did get an output for vig:

input decimal int: 2133923472
quaternary representation:
reconverted decimal : -2147483648
vigesimal representation: D6H
reconverted decimal : -2147483648

With known inputs and my own driver, I get the input,
but not any quat or vig output:

Program itox is ready to run first test...
input decimal int: 5
quaternary representation:
reconverted decimal : -2147483648
vigesimal representation:
reconverted decimal : -2147483648

Program itox is ready to run second test ...
input decimal int: 15
quaternary representation:
reconverted decimal : -2147483648
vigesimal representation:
reconverted decimal : -2147483648

Program itox is ready to run third test...
input decimal int: 515
quaternary representation:
reconverted decimal : -2147483648
vigesimal representation:
reconverted decimal : -2147483648
...

  a. loop gets inputs
      Your wrote a loop while (!EOF)
but it does not include the 9 lines,
so they are executed once.           -5

  b. quat is right/converts back
      Your quat looks like good code,
but does not give output.     -5
      The conversion back does not
give the input value.  The code overwrites
the quaternaryStr array, which is not
a good idea.  So this does not work yet -1
  c. viges is right/converts back
      Your viges usually does not gives 
output, but on one occasion it did.   -5
      It also does not convert back. -1

Ontime? LATE on itox and itoxDriver.c: Mar 5 23:05,
              but due at 5pm
     Your itox.c was not late and earned you the
     points you got.
